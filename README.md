Current version is 3.5.1:

1. when the combo gauge is full, press Shift to accelerate; however, if break, speed falls back to normal.

2. added UTF-8 mult-language support, add or modify text files in ./locale/*.txt to add a new language or edit string for an existing language. Currently, all other languages besides English and Chinese are obtained via Google Translate.

3. added multiple font support.


Programming guide:
- please set library and include paths for bass, dxsdk and FMOD-sound-system in ./src/external folder.
- all commits without any description are minor/trivial modifications such as editing description, fixing spelling errors, etc.

This work was originally created by the Chinese GameMaster Studio group (http://gamemastercn.com/).
It was later modified and enhanced by me (Wang Xuancong) for learning Window API, multimedia and computer graphics programming.
I will now release its source code to the open public to continue its development and enhancement.
