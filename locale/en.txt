1. During game, turn on CapsLock to prevent 'death'. However, once HP has gone below 0, HP gauge will turn black, final result will always be 'MISTAKE'\n2. During game, press F1~F4 to adjust and save note delay to the current map (see calibration.inf in that song's folder), press F5/F6 to adjust and save keyboard delay compensation, press PageUp/PageDown to adjust and save the volume of the current song\n3. Press +/- to adjust music tempo (maintain the same pitch), press F11/F12 to adjust music pitch (maintain the same tempo), press F7/F8 to adjust the speed of tail movement\n4. When PitchShiftDSP is disabled, the pitch cannot be changed independently from the tempo, (only the sampling rate is changed), but the music latency/delay is minimal\n5. To change the song folder address, add the following line to config.ini, songPath = [my_song_folder_path]\\n6. The song folder may contain sub-folders now so that you can reorganize your collection of songs\n7. Click on the progress bar to seek track to that position, press <Tab> to seek track to previous seek-track position; however, doing so will result in 'MISTAKE' for the final score
